### Data

The files to be read contain information from the *Census Bureau* in csv format. The aim is to create generic functions that can process and plot files in specific tabular format. Firstly, data processing steps will be applied to [File 1](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01a.csv).

### Data Processing

#### First Steps

The first step requires retuning specific columns from full set. This is made easier using the `tidyverse` packages. Loading the `tidyverse` packages using `require()` .

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
